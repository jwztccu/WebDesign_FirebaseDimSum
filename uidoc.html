    <h1>Cantonese Heritage Language Learning Tool</h1>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="calc-method">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Cantonese heritage language speakers may have difficulty maintaining their language abilities. Many heritage language schools are grassroots. I’d like to develop digital tools to support heritage language schools. The tools I develop will aim to be fun, engaging and relevant to students everyday lives. </p>
</section>

<section class="pseudo-element-method">
  <h1>Comparative research</h1>
  <p>Unfortunately there aren’t many Cantonese language learning applications. There are a few, but not as many as other languages, which limits the amount of learning resources.</p>
</section>

<section class="calc-method2">
  <h1>Verbal Descripiton of your design idea.</h1>
  <p>My site will feature engaging images, and content that is relevant to the learner’s life. For example, there will be an activity that features dim sum (a meal that is ineffectiveness of language learning apps and connected to an activity a Cantonese learner may encounter). The user will click on the images and will be able to hear the Cantonese pronunciation for the food item. They can take this to their next dim sum outting and use it to order food they like. </p>
</section>
  
  <section class="calc-method3">
  <h1>User Profile</h1>
  <p>The user I hope this site will serve is a Cantonese heritage language speaker/learner. Many heritage language learners never formally learn their language, and lack the literacy (reading/writing skills) to maintain their language skills. I hope this site will offer a fun and engaging tool that will help learners maintain their language skills.
